3. Once we activated the conda environment (which contains all the necessary packages to run the code) we can locate the file (the directory where we downloaded and unzipped the package) and enter the directory to be able to run the program. As an example if we unzipped our file in the Downloads directory we can open this directory using the `cd` Command. In Linux and Mac, the dashes are `/` while in windows we use `\`
```
cd Downloads\RapID-cell-counter-master
```

### Rerunning the program

To rerun the program once we closed it, we only have to reopen the terminal. Activate the RapID environment. Use the `cd` to navigate to the directory of the mainQT5.py file and the execute it using `python mainQT5.py`. Or run the following lines if the RapID source code is in Downloads:
```
conda activate RapID
cd Downloads\RapID-cell-counter-master
python mainQT5.py
```
